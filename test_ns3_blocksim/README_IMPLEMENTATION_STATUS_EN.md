## 2. Development Priorities

The following order of implementation for missing features is proposed:

1. **High Priority**:
   - Full integration of blockchain functionality with NS-3
   - Implementation of cryptographic checks and secure node registration
   - Implementation of complete consensus mechanism (PoA + PBFT)
   - Construction and verification of routes taking into account trust rating

2. **Medium Priority**:
   - Implementation of "heartbeat" transactions and node monitoring
   - Adaptation to topology changes and route reconstruction
   - Recovery mechanisms after failures
   - Performance and energy consumption optimization

3. **Low Priority**:
   - Blockchain sharding and consensus optimization
   - Advanced security mechanisms (Zero-knowledge proof, etc.)
   - Prediction of topology changes
   - System update policies

## 3. Implementation Recommendations

### 6G and MANET Integration
For full integration of 6G and MANET, it is necessary to add a 6G base station model to NS-3 with appropriate parameters:
- Implement higher data transfer rates
- Add larger coverage area for the base station
- Implement different operating modes for nodes within and outside the 6G coverage area

### Blockchain Functionality
The existing integration interface needs to be expanded to support:
- Complete blockchain structure with blocks and transactions
- Consensus mechanisms (PoA and PBFT)
- Transaction and block validation
- Registration of topology changes in the blockchain

### Security
To ensure security, the following is required:
- Add cryptographic algorithms for message signing
- Implement digital signature verification
- Create a trust management system based on node ratings
- Implement protection mechanisms against Sybil attacks and other types of attacks

### Routing
To improve routing, it is proposed to:
- Extend the AODV protocol to account for trust parameters
- Implement multipath routing
- Add route verification mechanisms
- Provide priority routing for mission-critical data

## 4. Conclusion

The current implementation provides a good foundation for integrating NS-3 and blockchain simulation, but requires significant enhancement to fully implement all the features described in the README. Special attention should be paid to security, consensus mechanism, and adaptation to topology changes, as these aspects are critical for the operation of a blockchain system in a mobile network environment.
