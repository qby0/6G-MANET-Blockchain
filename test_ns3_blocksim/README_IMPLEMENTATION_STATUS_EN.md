   - Implementation of cryptographic checks and secure node registration
   - Implementation of complete consensus mechanism (PoA + PBFT)
   - Construction and verification of routes taking into account trust rating

2. **Medium Priority**:

   - Prediction of topology changes
   - System update policies

## 3. Implementation Recommendations

### 6G and MANET Integration
For full integration of 6G and MANET, it is necessary to add a 6G base station model to NS-3 with appropriate parameters:
- Implement higher data transfer rates
- Add larger coverage area for the base station
- Implement different operating modes for nodes within and outside the 6G coverage area

### Blockchain Functionality
The existing integration interface needs to be expanded to support:
- Complete blockchain structure with blocks and transactions
- Consensus mechanisms (PoA and PBFT)
- Transaction and block validation
- Registration of topology changes in the blockchain

### Security
To ensure security, the following is required:
- Add cryptographic algorithms for message signing
- Implement digital signature verification
- Create a trust management system based on node ratings
- Implement protection mechanisms against Sybil attacks and other types of attacks

### Routing
To improve routing, it is proposed to:
- Extend the AODV protocol to account for trust parameters
- Implement multipath routing
- Add route verification mechanisms
- Provide priority routing for mission-critical data

## 4. Recently Implemented Features

### Single Base Station Simulation
- Implemented a simulation with a single stationary base station and mobile nodes
- Nodes move within a defined area at configurable speeds
- Nodes within base station coverage can communicate directly
- Nodes outside coverage use AODV routing through other nodes to reach the base station
- Dynamic topology updates based on node movement

### Internationalization
- All console output messages translated to English
- Documentation available in English
- Code comments updated to be consistent

### Enhanced Visualization
- Support for NS-3 animation output
- Tracking of node positions for visualization
- Flow monitoring for network traffic analysis

## 5. Conclusion

The current implementation provides a solid foundation for integrating NS-3 and blockchain simulation. Recent additions like the single base station simulation with AODV routing and mobile nodes significantly enhance the project's capabilities. The focus on internationalization makes the project more accessible to a wider audience. 

Moving forward, the priority should be on enhancing the blockchain functionality, particularly the consensus mechanism and security features. The integration between NS-3 and the blockchain simulation needs further development to fully realize the potential of this system in a mobile network environment.
