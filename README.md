# Blockchain-Enhanced 6G-MANET Integration

## Overview

This document outlines a conceptual algorithm for integrating a stationary 6G network infrastructure with a dynamic Mobile Ad Hoc Network (MANET) using blockchain technology. The goal is to enhance security, trust, adaptability, and efficiency in hybrid network environments characterized by both fixed infrastructure and mobile, self-organizing nodes.

## Project Goals

*   **Enhanced Security:** Provide robust mechanisms for node authentication, secure communication, and resistance against common network attacks (e.g., Sybil attacks).
*   **Decentralized Trust:** Establish a reliable trust and reputation system for network nodes using blockchain-based ratings.
*   **Adaptive Routing:** Enable dynamic route construction and verification that accounts for network topology changes, node trustworthiness, and resource availability.
*   **Resilient Operation:** Ensure continuous network operation and efficient recovery from node failures or network partitioning.
*   **Efficient Resource Management:** Optimize network performance and energy consumption, particularly for resource-constrained MANET nodes.
*   **Transparent Monitoring:** Provide a verifiable log of network events, node status, and route information.

## 1. System Architecture

The proposed system comprises:

*   **6G Base Station:** A stationary access point providing high-bandwidth connectivity and acting as a primary trust anchor and gateway.
*   **MANET Nodes:** Mobile devices forming a dynamic, self-configuring network beyond the direct coverage of the base station.
*   **Distributed Ledger (Blockchain):** A shared, immutable registry storing critical network information, including:
    *   Node identities and credentials
    *   Node trust ratings
    *   Network topology summaries
    *   Validated route information
    *   Security events

## 2. Node Lifecycle Management

### 2.1. Initialization

1.  The 6G base station initializes the blockchain's genesis block.
2.  Initial network parameters (coverage, thresholds, consensus settings) are defined.
3.  Trusted nodes within the base station's range are registered, forming an initial set of validators.

### 2.2. Registration

*   **Within 6G Coverage:**
    1.  New node sends a signed registration request to the base station.
    2.  Base station verifies credentials.
    3.  On success, a registration transaction is created and added to the blockchain via consensus.
    4.  Node receives a unique ID and keys.
*   **Outside 6G Coverage (MANET Zone):**
    1.  New node sends a request to a nearby active MANET node.
    2.  Receiving node verifies the signature.
    3.  A registration transaction is created and propagated.
    4.  Confirmation from a quorum of neighboring nodes is required.
    5.  Post-consensus, the node is registered on the blockchain, potentially with an "unverified" or "probationary" status and limited privileges until further validation (e.g., interaction with the base station or demonstrating sustained trustworthy behavior). *Design Note: The security implications and specific limitations of this status require careful definition.*

### 2.3. Activity Monitoring

*   **Heartbeats:** Nodes periodically broadcast "heartbeat" transactions containing status updates (location, battery, load). Frequency may adapt to network conditions. Missed heartbeats signal potential node unavailability.
*   **Neighbor Verification:** Nodes monitor immediate neighbors and report their status, helping to validate heartbeat information and detect inconsistencies.
*   **Data Correlation:** Smart contracts analyze monitoring data to maintain an up-to-date network map, flag anomalies, and potentially adjust node status or ratings. *Design Note: Storing high-frequency monitoring data directly on the main chain might require optimization (e.g., aggregation, off-chain processing) to ensure scalability.*

## 3. Security Mechanisms

### 3.1. Authentication

*   **Multi-Level Approach:**
    *   Digital certificate verification upon connection.
    *   Periodic rotation of session keys.
    *   Potential use of Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) for privacy-preserving identity verification. *Design Note: Resource requirements for ZKPs on constrained devices need evaluation.*

### 3.2. Trust and Reputation

*   **Dynamic Node Rating:** Each node maintains a trust score stored on the blockchain.
    *   Rating increases with successful participation (e.g., reliable data relay).
    *   Rating decreases due to detected failures or malicious behavior.
    *   Low-rated nodes may be excluded from sensitive routes or roles (e.g., validation).

### 3.3. Attack Resistance

*   **Sybil Attack Mitigation:**
    *   Rate limiting for new node registrations.
    *   Potential use of physical layer metrics (e.g., signal timing, location plausibility).
    *   Requiring validation from geographically diverse or highly trusted nodes.
*   **Anomaly Detection:** Continuous analysis of network traffic and node behavior patterns to identify potential attacks or compromised nodes.
*   **Response:** Automated mechanisms to isolate suspicious nodes and alert administrators.

## 4. Routing and Topology Management

### 4.1. Route Construction

1.  Sender initiates a route request specifying requirements (latency, reliability).
2.  Routing algorithms (e.g., modified Dijkstra, AODV) utilize network topology information.
3.  Blockchain data provides crucial metrics for path selection: node trust ratings, reported load, battery levels, connection stability history. *Design Note: Complex calculations are likely performed off-chain by nodes, querying the blockchain for necessary metrics, rather than executing the entire routing algorithm within a smart contract.*
4.  Multiple potential routes may be identified.

### 4.2. Route Verification and Selection

1.  Proposed routes can be submitted for verification by network validators.
2.  Verification checks node availability, security compliance, and potentially resource commitments.
3.  Verification results are recorded on the blockchain.
4.  Sender selects the optimal verified route based on its criteria.
5.  Data transmissions along the route can be logged (or sampled) on the blockchain to inform node ratings.

### 4.3. Adaptation to Changes

1.  Node status changes (joins, leaves, failures, connectivity fluctuations) are detected through monitoring.
2.  Significant topology changes trigger blockchain transactions.
3.  Affected routes are reassessed or reconstructed proactively based on updated topology and node status information.

## 5. Consensus Mechanism

*   **Hybrid Approach:**
    *   **Within 6G Coverage:** Lightweight consensus (e.g., Proof-of-Authority (PoA) anchored by the base station and trusted nodes).
    *   **MANET Zone:** Byzantine Fault Tolerant consensus (e.g., variant of PBFT) suitable for dynamic environments. *Design Note: Ensuring seamless and secure transition between consensus zones is a key challenge.*
*   **Hierarchical Validation:** Nodes may be categorized (e.g., full validators, light validators) based on resources, trust, and stability, allowing delegation of intensive tasks.
*   **Optimization:** Techniques like validator set management, transaction prioritization, and potentially sharding may be employed to enhance performance.

## 6. Fault Tolerance and Recovery

*   **Failure Detection:** Monitoring mechanisms identify node failures or network partitions (loss of synchronization, inconsistent blockchain views).
*   **Autonomous Operation:** Disconnected network segments aim to continue operating autonomously.
*   **Reconciliation:** Upon reconnection, a defined procedure merges blockchain states, resolving conflicts based on predefined rules (e.g., favoring segments with higher trust validators or base station connection). Potentially conflicting transactions may be rolled back.
*   **Local Reorganization:** Nodes adjacent to a failed node attempt to automatically restructure local connections to maintain network integrity.

## 7. Performance and Energy Optimization

*   **Adaptive Resource Management:** Nodes adjust behavior based on battery levels (energy-saving modes) and network load (dynamic task allocation).
*   **Data Optimization:** Use of lightweight transaction formats, potential pruning/summarization of historical blockchain data (using techniques like state commitments), and adaptive block parameters.
*   **Predictive Mechanisms:** Analyzing node mobility patterns to anticipate topology changes and proactively adjust routing or resource allocation.

## 8. System Updates

*   Secure distribution and verification of software/policy updates via the blockchain.
*   Multi-stage validation process involving trusted nodes.
*   Gradual rollout mechanisms with rollback capabilities.
