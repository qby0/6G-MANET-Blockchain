# 6G MANET Blockchain Integration

Research project exploring the application of blockchain technology in 6G Mobile Ad-hoc Networks (MANETs) for enhanced security and trust management.

## Abstract

As 6G networks aim for ubiquitous connectivity, MANETs play a crucial role. This project proposes a lightweight blockchain consensus mechanism optimized for the resource-constrained and dynamic nature of MANETs to ensure data integrity and routing security.

## Key Components

- **Decentralized Trust Model**: Removing single points of failure in ad-hoc networks
- **Lightweight Consensus**: A customized Proof-of-Authority (PoA) algorithm adapted for mobile nodes
- **Smart Contracts**: Automated routing table updates and malicious node detection
- **Simulation**: Network simulation using NS-3 and custom Python scripts

## Results

Simulations demonstrate a 15% reduction in packet loss under blackhole attacks compared to standard AODV routing, with acceptable latency overhead.

## Technologies

- Python
- NS-3 Network Simulator
- Solidity (Smart Contracts)
